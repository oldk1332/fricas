This is experimental code based on the FriCAS computer algebra system here:
https://github.com/fricas/fricas

The stuff I am working on is in this directory:
https://github.com/martinbaker/fricas/tree/spad-interpreter/src/spadinterp

This is an experiment to see how much of the FriCAS interpreter that I can
write using SPAD code. Currently the interpreter is written in 'boot' code.
For example in int-top.boot, server.boot, i-toplev.boot i-syscmd.boot
and many others.

The eventual aim is to find a way to implement things on my wishlist here:
http://www.euclideanspace.com/prog/scratchpad/fricas/wishlist/
It seems unlikely that FriCAS will be able to do these things anytime soon.

For more information about what I am trying to do see this page:

There is no point in compiling from here, if you want to try the code
follow the instructions on the page linked above.
